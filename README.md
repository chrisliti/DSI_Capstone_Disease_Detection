# Overview

This repo entails code for developing an object detection algorithm to detect plant diseases. The YOLOV5 algorithm will be utilized for this project.

The data utilized to train the model is the Plant Doc datset from India.

This repo was cloned from the official YOLOV5 repo ultralytics and customized for this project.

## Project Files:

1. data: Contains path to datasets and yaml file with configurations.
2. models: Contains the pre-loaded YOLOV5 algorithms.
3. runs: Contains the run experiments and results.
4. streamlit_detection_app.py: App detailing object detection web app development.
5. train.py: Script for running object detection.
6. detect.py: Script for testing a video or image.
